This is the first post on my blog. Typically people use their first post to talk about themselves or like "what they intend their blog to be about". I'd like to show you my dogs. Dogs are sick.

## Ludo the Labrador

This dog is absolutely, without argument, the love of my life. Ludo is my absolute best friend, and I weirdly feel as if I have him to thank for turning into an adult that can successfully manage a 401k. He passed away in December of 2024 due to Lymphatic Cancer and let me tell you, I did NOT take that shit well. Even sitting here in the early parts of 2026 I tear up thinking about the guy.

Anywho, I love Ludo very, very much, and I'm extremely humbled and privileged to have been able to call myself his dog-father. I think we can ALL agree, fuck cancer.

## Mika the Chesapeake Bay Retriever

I got Mika back during COVID-19, specifically in the Summer of 2020 as a puppy. Mika loves to play fetch and wrestle with both Ludo and her new and younger brother Ember. She's SO photogenic, proven very obviously by her picture below. She loves love, and does that whole thing where dogs try to "pet you back" when you pet her. I've been working from home practically full-time since COVID, and I couldn't ask for a better in-office co-worker. Though she doesn't really pull her weight much, to be fair.

## Ember the Bernedoodle

Ember is HILARIOUS. We got Ember a month or so after Ludo passed away, in January of 2025. When we first got him, I was SUPER concerned that he would be high-maintenance, and boy was I right in the best way possible. This dog LOVES to cuddle. He'll walk over to you and literally trustfall into your arms while looking up at you as if to say "Hey Dad, I love you". He came into our life at just the right moment, and he's definitely the bees knees.

## Anywho...

Okay so anyway, I plan to have this blog actually be productive. Fingers crossed the next iteration of technology-specific bloggary will not be too far off!
